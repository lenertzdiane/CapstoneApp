# CapstoneApp

An app made for a one month Capstone project at Ada Developers Academy using a MEAN stack and d3.js to visualize the path of a character on a map as the story is read.
I made an interface to add/edit/rearrange stories as well as view them, but that capability is disabled on the deployed app, as the app is meant as a platform for my own writing and not a tool to be used by the public.
