# Plot

Plot is a web application made for a one month Capstone project at Ada Developers Academy using a MEAN stack and d3.js to visualize the path of a character on a map as the story is read.
There exists an interface to add/edit/rearrange stories as well as view them, but that capability is disabled on the deployed app, as the app is meant as a platform for my own writing and not a tool to be used by the public. Please view the linked video below to see the add and rearrange functionality in action.
