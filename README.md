# Groupthink.television

An app made for a one month Capstone project at Ada Developers Academy using a MEAN stack (Mongodb, Express.js, Node.js, Angular 5) and d3.js, deployed on heroku to visualize the path of a character on a map as the reader scrolls through the story.

There is an interface to add/edit/rearrange stories as well as view them, but that capability is disabled on the deployed app, as the app is meant as a platform for my own writing and not a tool to be used by the public.
